✅ Implemented Algorithms

🔹 DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) 
Applied on make_blobs dataset

Successfully identified clusters of varying density

Handled noise and outliers effectively

🔹 K-Means Clustering
Applied on make_moons dataset

Demonstrated the limitations of K-Means on non-spherical, complex-shaped datasets

Explained why K-Means struggles with non-linear boundaries

🔹 PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Applied on make_blobs dataset

Reduced dimensionality for better visualization

Preserved key variance and structure of the dataset

🔍 Key Insight
K-Means performs well on spherical clusters but fails on non-spherical data like make_moons. This highlights the importance of choosing the right clustering algorithm based on the shape and distribution of the data.
